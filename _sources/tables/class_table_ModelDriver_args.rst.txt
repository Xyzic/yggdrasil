args                Argument(s) for running the model on the command line. This should be a complete   X          str or list
                    command including the necessary executable and command line arguments to that                            
                    executable.                                                                                              
client_of           The names of one or more servers that this model is a client of. Defaults to                  str, list  
                    empty list. Use of client_of with function is not currently supported.                                   
function            If provided, an integrated model is created by wrapping the function named here.              str        
                    The function must be located within the file specified by the source file listed                         
                    in the first argument. If not provided, the model must contain it's own calls to                         
                    the |yggdrasil| interface.                                                                               
is_server           If True, the model is assumed to be a server and an instance of                               bool       
                    :class:`yggdrasil.drivers.ServerDriver` is started. Defaults to False. Use of                            
                    is_server with function is not currently supported.                                                      
model_index         Index of model in list of models being run. Defaults to 0.                                    int        
name                Driver name.                                                                       X          str        
outputs_in_inputs   If True, outputs from wrapped model functions are passed by pointer as inputs                 bool       
                    for modification and the return value will be a flag. If False, outputs are                              
                    limited to return values. Defaults to the value of the class attribute                                   
                    outputs_in_inputs.                                                                                       
overwrite           If True, any existing model products (compilation products, wrapper scripts,                  bool       
                    etc.) are removed prior to the run. If False, the products are not removed.                              
                    Defaults to True. Setting this to False can improve the performance,                                     
                    particularly for models that take a long time to compile, but this should only                           
                    be done once the model has been fully debugged to ensure that each run is tested                         
                    on a clean copy of the model. The value of this keyword also determines whether                          
                    or not products are removed after a run.                                                                 
preserve_cache      If True model products will be kept following the run, otherwise all products                 bool       
                    will be cleaned up. Defaults to False. This keyword is superceeded by overwrite.                         
products            Paths to files created by the model that should be cleaned up when the model                  list       
                    exits. Entries can be absolute paths or paths relative to the working directory.                         
                    Defaults to [].                                                                                          
source_products     Files created by running the model that are source files. These files will be                 list       
                    removed without checking their extension so users should avoid adding files to                           
                    this list unless they are sure they should be deleted. Defaults to [].                                   
strace_flags        Flags to pass to strace (or dtrace). Defaults to [].                                          list       
valgrind_flags      Flags to pass to valgrind. Defaults to [].                                                    list       
with_strace         If True, the command is run with strace (on Linux) or dtrace (on MacOS).                      bool       
                    Defaults to False.                                                                                       
with_valgrind       If True, the command is run with valgrind. Defaults to False.                                 bool
