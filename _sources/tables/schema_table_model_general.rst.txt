args                array                Argument(s) for running the model on the command line. This should be a complete
                                         command including the necessary executable and command line arguments to that   
                                         executable.                                                                     
client_of           array     X          The names of one or more servers that this model is a client of. Defaults to    
                                         empty list. Use of client_of with function is not currently supported.          
driver              string    X          [DEPRECATED] Name of driver class that should be used.                          
function            string    X          If provided, an integrated model is created by wrapping the function named here.
                                         The function must be located within the file specified by the source file listed
                                         in the first argument. If not provided, the model must contain it's own calls to
                                         the |yggdrasil| interface.                                                      
inputs              array     X          Model inputs described as comm objects.                                         
is_server           boolean   X          If True, the model is assumed to be a server and an instance of                 
                                         :class:`yggdrasil.drivers.ServerDriver` is started. Defaults to False. Use of   
                                         is_server with function is not currently supported.                             
language            string               The programming language that the model is written in. (Options described       
                                         :ref:`here <schema_table_model_subtype_rst>`)                                   
name                string               Name used for component in log messages.                                        
outputs             array     X          Model outputs described as comm objects.                                        
outputs_in_inputs   boolean   X          If True, outputs from wrapped model functions are passed by pointer as inputs   
                                         for modification and the return value will be a flag. If False, outputs are     
                                         limited to return values. Defaults to the value of the class attribute          
                                         outputs_in_inputs.                                                              
overwrite           boolean   X          If True, any existing model products (compilation products, wrapper scripts,    
                                         etc.) are removed prior to the run. If False, the products are not removed.     
                                         Defaults to True. Setting this to False can improve the performance,            
                                         particularly for models that take a long time to compile, but this should only  
                                         be done once the model has been fully debugged to ensure that each run is tested
                                         on a clean copy of the model. The value of this keyword also determines whether 
                                         or not products are removed after a run.                                        
preserve_cache      boolean   X          If True model products will be kept following the run, otherwise all products   
                                         will be cleaned up. Defaults to False. This keyword is superceeded by overwrite.
products            array     X          Paths to files created by the model that should be cleaned up when the model    
                                         exits. Entries can be absolute paths or paths relative to the working directory.
                                         Defaults to [].                                                                 
source_products     array     X          Files created by running the model that are source files. These files will be   
                                         removed without checking their extension so users should avoid adding files to  
                                         this list unless they are sure they should be deleted. Defaults to [].          
strace_flags        array     X          Flags to pass to strace (or dtrace). Defaults to [].                            
valgrind_flags      array     X          Flags to pass to valgrind. Defaults to [].                                      
with_strace         boolean   X          If True, the command is run with strace (on Linux) or dtrace (on MacOS).        
                                         Defaults to False.                                                              
with_valgrind       boolean   X          If True, the command is run with valgrind. Defaults to False.                   
working_dir         string               Working directory. If not provided, the current working directory is used.
